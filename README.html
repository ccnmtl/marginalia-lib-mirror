<h1>Marginalia Library Readme</h1>

<p>This is the Marginalia client-side annotation library.  When integrated with a
web application, it allows users to highlight passages of text and create margin
notes.  You can find a stand-alone demo and other resources on the
<a href="http://www.geof.net/code/annotation">Marginalia web site</a>.</p>

<p>This library <strong>is not a working application</strong>.  It is missing
essential functions and other parts of the implementation (such as the server
side), including localization, the database specification, some callbacks,
configuration options, etc.  It is a separate project to make it a straightforward
drop-in library for use in multiple host applications.</p>

<p>If you want to test out Marginalia, you must connect it to a web application.
The Marginalia demo application is the simplest candidate.  Developers may also
find other implementations with real-world applications helpful - such as OJS
for the clarity of its integration, and Moodle for some of its additional
features (e.g. searchable annotations and more sophisticated user permissions).</p>

<h2>License &amp; Funding</h2>

<p>I want to particularly thank BC Campus for funding this effort, and for allowing 
its release under the GNU General Public License, and to Simon Fraser University 
through Dr. Andrew Feenberg's Applied Communication and Technology Lab in the School 
of Communication and through the Learning and Instructional Development Centre
for their financial support.  Malaspina University-College has also been supportive,
as they provided a test site for Marginalia for Moodle.</p>

<p>Open Journal Systems support and other improvements to Marginalia were 
made possible by Dr. Rick Kopak's "Navigating Information 
Spaces" project at the University of British Columbia, funded by the Social Sciences 
and Humanities Research Council of Canada.  Chia-ning Chiang and John Willinsky have 
also been essential in getting this project off the ground.</p>

<h2>Limitations and Known Bugs</h2>

<p>I am aware of several limitations with the software:</p>

<ul>
<li>This version has only been tested with Firefox.  IE support is likely broken
for the moment.  Other browsers may work if and when they support relevant
web standards.  Note that I did develop IE support;  I simply haven't had the
time to keep it up-to-date with the most recent improvements to the system.
Fixing it should be a matter of a bit of (painful) debugging.</li>
<li>I have only tried annotation with a MySQL database.  It's possible there
are incompatibilities with others (e.g. Postgres).</li>
<li>Marginalia is incompatible with the Firefox "Auto Copy" extension if the
extension is set to automatically clear the selection once it has been copied
(this can be modified with the "Auto Copy" preferences).</li>
</ul>
