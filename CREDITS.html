<h1>Marginalia Credits</h1>

<p>I (Geof Glass) wrote nearly all of the code for this project.</p>

<p>I want to particularly thank BC Campus for funding this effort, and for allowing 
its release under the GNU General Public License, and to Simon Fraser University 
through Dr. Andrew Feenberg's Applied Communication and Technology Lab in the School 
of Communication and through the Learning and Instructional Development Centre
for their financial support.  Malaspina University-College has also been supportive,
as they provided a test site for Marginalia for Moodle.</p>

<p>Open Journal Systems support and further improvements were made possible by Dr. 
Rick Kopak's "Navigating Information Spaces" project at the University of British 
Columbia, funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.  
Chia-ning Chiang and John Willinsky have also been essential in getting this project 
off the ground.</p>

<p>In addition, the following people have provided moral and technical support.  
Without these people and organizations this software would not exist.  In rough 
chronological order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cindy Xin</li>
<li>Eric Schewe</li>
<li>Brent Lee</li>
<li>Trevor Bradley</li>
<li>Tom Lodge</li>
<li>Peter Reitsma</li>
<li>Alec Smecher</li>
</ul>
